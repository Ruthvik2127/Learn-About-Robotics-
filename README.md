## What is Robotics ?
Robotics is the engineering and operation of machines that can perform physical functions independently or independently on behalf of a person. Robots often perform tasks that are either repetitive or extremely dangerous.
Mechanical robots use sensors, actuators and data operations to interact with the physical world. A robotics person must have a solid background in mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, and computer programming.

In recent years the field of robotics has begun to take on a new dimension for machine learning and artificial intelligence. To help avoid confusion, the word bot is no longer used to describe a body robot. Instead, it is used to describe a software robot that does not have a repair body.


## Uses of Robotics on Field 
The field of robotics has greatly improved with the advent of new technologies. Another increase in big data, which offers an additional opportunity to build planning capacity in robotic systems. Another use of new types of sensors and connected devices is to monitor environmental factors such as temperature, air pressure, light, movement and more. All of this facilitates robots and the production of robots that are sophisticated and advanced in many applications, including manufacturing, health and safety, and human assistance.

## Robotics on AI & Future 
The field of robotics also encounters problems around artificial intelligence. Since robots are units that are physically separate, they are considered to be their own intelligence, even if one is limited by their design and power. This theory has created new controversy over traditional scientific theories, such as Asimov's three laws of robots, which discuss the future interaction of robots with the machine.

## About Ardinuo 
Ardinuo is one of a open-source platform for making of many various types of projects and robots. Used by many students, hobbyists, artists, programmers, and professionals.
Teachers and students use it to build cost-effective science tools, to prove the principles of chemical and physics, or to develop systems and robots. Designers and builders create interactive prototypes, which artists use to install and experiment with new musical instruments. The makers, in fact, use it to build many of the projects .Arduino is a great tool for learning new things. Anyone like  kids or programmers - can start thinking by doin projects from scratch to an expert level .


## Our Robot Simulation Diagram
We have made a Project on Obstacle Avoiding Robot using Ardiuno and Tinkercad Platform by which we have run the code in the Tinkercad software .

## Team Work  
Atlast we team have successfully created an Obstacle Avoiding Robot  by Using Ardiuno and Tinkercad Software ..without them it wouldn't be possible till here !!!âœ¨ðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜Š
