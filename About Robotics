What is Robotics ?
Robotics is the engineering and operation of machines that can perform physical functions independently or independently on behalf of a person. Robots often perform tasks that are either repetitive or extremely dangerous.
Mechanical robots use sensors, actuators and data operations to interact with the physical world. A robotics person must have a solid background in mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, and computer programming.
In recent years the field of robotics has begun to take on a new dimension for machine learning and artificial intelligence. To help avoid confusion, the word bot is no longer used to describe a body robot. Instead, it is used to describe a software robot that does not have a repair body.
